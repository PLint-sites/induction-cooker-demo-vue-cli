# Induction cooker Demo

When preparing diner after a day of programming on a Vue project, I was intrigued by the workings of our induction cooker. A lot is going on once you start interacting with it to cook a meal: you turn on the cooker, put some pots and pans on the heaters, turn on individual heaters, start a timer, and so on. That’s a lot of actions, mutations and states… At that moment, I thought it would be fun to create an induction cooker in Vue.

This repository contains the demo code for the induction cooker we'll be building together throughout a series of blogposts.
